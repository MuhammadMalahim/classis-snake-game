# Classic Snake Game (MVC Architecture)

This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Snake game, structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It serves as an educational example of applying MVC principles in game development.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Separates the game's data (Model), user interface (View), and control logic (Controller) for modularity and maintainability.
- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate the snake to consume food, grow in length, and avoid collisions with walls or itself.
- **Java Implementation**: Developed entirely in Java, making use of object-oriented programming concepts.

## Project Structure
