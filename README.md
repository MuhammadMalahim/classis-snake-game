# Classic Snake Game (MVC Architecture)

This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Snake game, structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It serves as an educational example of applying MVC principles in game development.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Separates the game's data (Model), user interface (View), and control logic (Controller) for modularity and maintainability.
- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate the snake to consume food, grow in length, and avoid collisions with walls or itself.
- **Java Implementation**: Developed entirely in Java, making use of object-oriented programming concepts.

## Core Concepts

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Clean separation of responsibilities between game logic, rendering, and input handling.
- **Event Handling**: Keyboard input (WASD) for movement and optional mouse events.
- **Simple Graphics**: Utilizes Java's built-in drawing libraries for basic sprite-based rendering.
- **Game State Management**: Implements a timer for level timing and game-over conditions.
- **Level System**: Supports loading predefined levels or procedurally generating solvable ones.
- **Persistence**: Maintains a high score table for the top 10 players using basic file I/O or storage methods.
